title: "How to not worry about networking on AWS?"
description: "In this follow-up episode of the AWS Developers Podcast, we continue the conversation with Alex Huides, Principal Network Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS, focusing on Amazon VPC Lattice. We explore how developers can simplify networking concerns while maintaining robust connectivity between applications. Alex explains how VPC Lattice introduces a new boundary concept called service networks, which allows applications to communicate across accounts and VPCs regardless of IP overlap issues. The discussion covers how VPC Lattice abstracts away complex networking details, replacing traditional load balancers while providing secure, private connectivity between services. This episode demonstrates how AWS is removing undifferentiated heavy lifting in networking, making it easier for developers to focus on building applications."
