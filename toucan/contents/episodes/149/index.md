title:  "Blue green deployment for your databases"
description: "In this episode, we talked with Keyur Diwan to dive deep into the concept of Blue-Green Deployment, particularly in the context of databases on AWS. We discuss the origins of this deployment strategy and how it has evolved to suit cloud environments. The conversation covers the benefits, challenges, and cost implications of implementing Blue-Green Deployment for stateful systems like databases, focusing on replication, schema changes, and the switchover process.

Tune in to learn how Blue-Green Deployment can help reduce downtime, enhance database performance, and simplify change management, as well as explore future trends that aim to make this deployment model more robust and user-friendly."
