title: "Lambda Runtimes deep dive: Behind the serverless curtain"
description: "In this episode, we dive deep into AWS Lambda runtime environments with Maxime David, Software Development Engineer in the Lambda runtime team. Discover how AWS manages and updates the foundation of serverless computing, ensuring millions of functions continue to run smoothly while being patched and updated behind the scenes. Learn about the complex deployment processes, security considerations, and the team's commitment to maintaining backwards compatibility. Maxime explains how Lambda runtimes are structured, from the operating system to language support and AWS SDK integration. We also discuss custom runtimes, the role of Firecracker in providing isolation, and the team's efforts toward open-sourcing their work"
