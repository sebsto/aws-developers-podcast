title: "Chris Miller on AI Coding, Multi-Agent Systems, and the Silicon Valley Vibe"
description: "Join us for an engaging conversation with Chris Miller, an AWS Hero since 2021 and AI Software Engineer at Workato. Chris shares his journey from accidentally winning a DeepRacer competition to becoming a community leader in the San Francisco Bay Area. We dive deep into the realities of AI-assisted development, exploring multi-agent architectures, the Road to re:Invent hackathon experience, and what it's really like to be building in Silicon Valley's AI boom.
Discover how Chris moved from DeepRacer champion to AWS Hero and community leader, his experience building a multi-agent imposter architecture featuring Jeff Barr, Swami, and Werner Vogels for the Road to re:Invent Hackathon, and the reality of moving beyond 'vibe coding' to responsible AI development. Learn about multi-agent orchestration patterns, token management, recursion limits, and the current state of AI development in San Francisco.
Chris shares insights on developer tools like Kiro, the Strands framework, autonomous agents, and best practices for code review, testing, and transparency in AI-generated code. Whether you're exploring AI-assisted development, building multi-agent systems, or curious about the Silicon Valley AI scene, this conversation offers practical insights from the trenches."
