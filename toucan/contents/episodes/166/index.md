title:  "Multi-Model Magic: Inside SurrealDB"
description: "In this episode of the AWS Developers Podcast, host Sebastien Stormacq sits down with Toby, CEO and co-founder of SurrealDB, to explore the world of multi-model databases. They unpack how SurrealDB stands out by cleanly separating storage from compute, supporting multiple data models within a single engine, and delivering a developer-friendly experience through its web-based tools and Rust-powered core. Toby shares insights into the journey from Golang to Rust, explains how developers can use SurrealDB as either an embedded library or a server, and discusses real-world use cases from edge deployments to real-time decision-making in the cloud. The conversation highlights how open source, performance, and scalability intersect in this modern database technology designed to meet the demands of today’s applications."
