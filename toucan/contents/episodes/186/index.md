description: "In this episode of the AWS Developers Podcast, we dive deep into Strands Agents, AWS's open-source framework for building AI agents. Our guest Arron Bailiss, Principal Engineer and Tech Lead for Strands, explains how this framework evolved from an internal AWS tool to a developer-friendly, open-source solution. Learn how Strands simplifies AI agent development with just a few lines of code while maintaining production-ready capabilities. Aaron discusses the framework's unique model-driven approach, its support for both MCP and A2A protocols, and how it powers various AWS services including Amazon Q Developer and AWS Glue. Discover how Strands enables multi-agent systems through swarms, supports various deployment options, and get insights into the roadmap including TypeScript support and voice agent capabilities."
