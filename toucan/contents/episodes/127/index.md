description: "In this conversation, Seb and Yan Cui discuss the definition of serverless and its key characteristics. They also address the misconception that serverless is dead and clarify that it is still a thriving technology. Yan shares his experience with serverless projects and highlights the importance of focusing on one or two major changes at a time to avoid failure. They also discuss the use of relational databases with Lambda and the benefits of using Aurora Serverless and the Data API. The conversation covers good patterns for building serverless applications, including taking smaller steps in migrations, splitting applications into services, and designing event-driven architectures. It emphasizes the importance of visibility, testing, and observability in serverless applications. The guest recommends using remote testing for most projects and highlights the benefits of using Lumigo for observability.
