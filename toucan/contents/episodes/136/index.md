title:  "AWS Lambda Snap Start"
description: "In this conversation, Vadym Kazulkin discusses AWS Lambda Snap Start, a feature designed to reduce cold start latency for Java applications in AWS Lambda. The discussion covers the challenges of cold starts, how Snap Start works, its impact on performance, and optimization techniques such as priming. Kazulkin shares insights from his extensive benchmarking and the implications for developers using AWS Lambda. The discussion also touches on challenges developers may face when using Snap Start, particularly in relation to randomness and caching mechanisms. Kazulkin encourages developers to revisit Java on Lambda with the new optimizations available, highlighting the evolving landscape of serverless computing."
