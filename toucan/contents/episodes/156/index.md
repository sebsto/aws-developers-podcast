title:  "Lambda Event Sources: From Infrastructure to Implementation"
description: "Hosts Tiffany Souterre and Sebastien Stormacq sit down with Rajesh Pandey to explore the critical role of events in AWS Lambda. They dive deep into how events trigger Lambda functions and how AWS has built infrastructure to ensure high availability while optimizing costs for customers.
Rajesh explains the various event sources supported by Lambda and discusses important considerations around streaming data, latency, and performance. The conversation covers essential topics for developers including message handling, at-least-once delivery guarantees, and the developer's responsibility in tracking and managing messages.
The trio explores advanced features such as event filtering—a highly popular capability that has evolved rapidly—and batching configurations that can significantly impact application performance. They also discuss observability best practices essential for successful service integrations and recent innovations with Kafka that offer ultra-low latency options.
Whether you're new to serverless or an experienced Lambda developer, this episode provides valuable insights into building resilient, cost-effective, and high-performing event-driven architectures on AWS."
