title:  "Cancer Research UK goes Serverless"
description: "In this episode of the AWS Developers Podcast, we explore the first major step in Cancer Research UK’s broader move to serverless: the migration of their payment systems. While this application was the first to make the shift, it paved the way for many other products and services that have since followed suit—marking a significant milestone in their serverless journey. Our guests, Eli Wintram and Sueta Poduturi, walk us through the motivations behind the migration, the architecture decisions that shaped it, and the key AWS services that made it possible. They share how technologies like AWS Lambda and DynamoDB enabled cost savings of up to 94%, why TypeScript was the right fit for their microservices, and how observability and load testing were central to building trust in the new system. Whether you're planning a migration or curious about serverless best practices in production, this episode is packed with technical insights and practical lessons from the field."
