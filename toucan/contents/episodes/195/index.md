title: "From MCP to Multi-Agents: The Evolution of Agentic AI (and What's Next)"
description: "Mike Chambers reflects on 2025 as 'the year of agents' - though not quite in the way he predicted. From MCP's rocky launch to the rise of AI coding assistants, Mike shares hard-won lessons about what actually worked in production, the security challenges developers face, and why the future might be about giving agents access to filesystems and command lines rather than endless tool definitions.
Discover how MCP evolved from standard IO to becoming the plugin ecosystem for IDEs, the security concerns around giving agents local machine access, and context overloading challenges. Mike walks through the framework evolution from heavy prompt engineering to model-centric approaches, why he abandoned his own framework for Strands Agents, and the rise of lightweight frameworks like ADK, Strands, and Spring AI.
Learn about the real agent success story of 2025: AI coding assistants like Kiro, and Claude Code expanding beyond just code. Mike shares insights on agent skills for progressive disclosure, giving agents filesystem and command line access, long-running multi-agent systems, and moving from laptop productivity to production-scale agents."
