title:  "Ryanair: a journey towards responsible AI"
description: "In this episode of the AWS Developer Podcast, we dive into Ryanair's journey towards responsible AI. As the airline aims to carry 300 million passengers in less than a decade, it is turning to generative AI to enhance productivity and scale operations. The conversation explores how Ryanair is identifying and implementing use cases, the role of its generative AI center of excellence, and the importance of embedding governance into AI from the very start. You'll hear how the airline is balancing agility with compliance through the creation of an AI compliance hub and a flexible, evolving framework to manage AI risks. The speakers share candid insights into lessons learned, the challenges of cross-functional collaboration, and why responsible AI is a continuous process—one that future teams will be grateful for."
