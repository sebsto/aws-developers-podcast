title: "When AI meets biology: Using LLM to find natural alternatives to antibiotics"
description: "In this episode, we explore how Phagos, a French biotech startup, combines biology, data science, and cloud computing to combat antimicrobial resistance. Their innovative approach uses bacteriophages - natural predators of bacteria - as an alternative to antibiotics. We discuss how they leverage AWS services, including SageMaker and batch processing, to analyze genomic data and train specialized language models that can predict phage-bacteria interactions. Our guests explain how they process terabytes of genetic data, train and deploy AI models, and create user-friendly interfaces for their lab scientists. This fascinating conversation reveals how cloud computing and artificial intelligence are revolutionizing biotechnology and potentially helping solve one of this century's biggest health challenges."
