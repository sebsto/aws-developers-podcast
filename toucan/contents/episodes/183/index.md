title: "Scaling E-commerce with Serverless: The Moonpig Story"
description: "In this episode, we dive deep into Moonpig's migration journey from an on-premise ASP.NET monolithic application to a fully serverless architecture on AWS. Richard Pearson, Head of Engineering, and Alexis Lowe, Principal Engineer at Moonpig, share their experience transforming a 25-year-old e-commerce platform. They discuss how they tackled the challenges of migrating from SQL Server to DynamoDB, implemented multi-region deployment, and achieved seamless scalability for their peak trading periods. Learn about their \"no VPC\" policy, their approach to observability, and how they organized their teams to embrace DevOps culture. This episode is particularly relevant for organizations considering a similar journey to serverless architecture or looking to scale their platforms globally."
