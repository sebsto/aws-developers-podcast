title: "Native Speed, Modern Safety: Swift for Backend Development"
description: "Join us as we explore Swift beyond iOS with Sebastien Stormacq, AWS Developer Advocate and Swift specialist. Discover why Swift is becoming a compelling choice for server-side development, offering native compilation, memory safety without garbage collection, and modern concurrency features that deliver exceptional performance and cost efficiency.

Seb shares how Apple processes billions of daily requests using Swift on AWS infrastructure, achieving 40% better performance and 30% lower costs when migrating services from Java. We dive into the technical advantages that make Swift competitive with traditional backend languages, explore the vibrant server-side ecosystem with frameworks like Vapor and Hummingbird, and discuss practical implementations including serverless architectures on AWS Lambda.

Whether you're a Swift developer curious about server-side possibilities, a full-stack developer looking to unify your tech stack, or a backend engineer evaluating language options, this conversation offers practical insights into Swift's capabilities beyond the client."
