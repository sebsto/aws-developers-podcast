description: "In this episode of the AWS Developers Podcast, we dive deep into Amazon Bedrock Agent Core Identity with Abram Douglas. Learn how this new service helps developers manage identities and authentication flows for AI agents at scale. Discover the seven core components of Agent Core and understand how the identity service simplifies complex OAuth2 flows and token management. Whether you're building AI agents that need to interact with third-party services like Google Calendar or Slack, this episode explains how Agent Core Identity removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting of identity management, token vaulting, and secure credential handling. Perfect for developers looking to deploy production-ready AI agents with enterprise-grade security."
