description: "In this episode recorded live from AWS Summit Bangalore, we dive deep into AWS Lambda Extensions and Observability with Jones, a serverless hero and developer advocate at New Relic. Learn about the critical role of observability in serverless architectures, how Lambda Extensions work as sidecars to enhance monitoring capabilities, and the different types of extensions available. Jones explains the extension lifecycle, APIs, and implementation details while sharing real-world use cases from security compliance to distributed tracing. Whether you're an enterprise developer or curious about building custom extensions, this episode provides valuable insights into making your serverless applications more observable and manageable."
