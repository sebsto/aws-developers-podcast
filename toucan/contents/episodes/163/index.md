title:  "The golden jacket: a journey towards 12 AWS certifications"
description: "In this episode of the AWS Developers Podcast, we sit down with Ivan Casco, Principal Solutions Architect, AWS Community Builder, and one of the rare few to have earned all 14 AWS certifications—an achievement that earned him the coveted Golden Jacket. Ivan takes us through his remarkable journey, from his first certification back in 2017 to joining the Community Builders program in 2023, and finally reaching the full set of certifications in 2025. Based between Spain and Dublin, Ivan shares what drove him to pursue this challenge, how he stayed motivated, and which certifications pushed him the most—spoiler alert: networking and machine learning were no walk in the park. We also dive into his favorite study techniques, what it’s really like to sit through the exams, and how these certifications have impacted both his confidence and his career. If you're thinking about starting your own AWS certification path—or you're in the middle of one—this conversation is full of practical advice, community insight, and inspiration. Plus, find out what the golden jacket moment was really like."
