title:  "Jeff Barr: 20 years of blogging"
description: "In this special episode of the AWS Developers Podcast, Tiffany and Seb sit down with Jeff Barr, VP and Chief Evangelist at AWS, to celebrate 20 incredible years of the AWS News blog. Jeff shares the origin story of the blog, the values that shaped its growth, and his unique approach to making technical concepts accessible to developers worldwide.

Jeff also reflects on some of the blog’s milestone moments, from covering the beta release of Amazon SQS in 2004 to the launches of Amazon S3 and EC2 in 2006.

With the announcement of his decision to step away from the AWS News blog to focus on deep-dive development activities, Jeff opens up about what’s next for him and his passion for technology.

Join us as we celebrate two decades of impactful blogging and gain insights into Jeff’s remarkable journey at AWS."
