title: "Deploying MCP servers on Lambda"
description: "Update Oct 25.: After we recorded this episode (July 10th 2025), AWS launched Amazon Bedrock AgentCore (that went in preview on July 16th, 2025) and generally available since Oct. 13rd, 2025. AgentCore is the recommanded solution to deploy your MCP agents on AWS. We keep this episode available as a learning experience but deploying MCP on Lambda is not the recommanded architecture for your production workloads.

In this episode, we dive deep into MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers on AWS Lambda. We explore what MCP is, how it enables AI systems to interact with tools through standardized protocols, and practical implementations on AWS Lambda. The discussion covers authentication mechanisms, deployment strategies, and the future potential of MCP servers as a marketplace for AI capabilities. Whether you're building AI-powered applications or interested in exposing your business capabilities to AI systems, this episode provides valuable insights into the technical aspects and business opportunities of MCP servers."
