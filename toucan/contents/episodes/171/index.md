title:  "How I learned to stop worrying and love chaos (Engineering)"
description: "In this episode of the AWS Developers Podcast, recorded live at the AWS Summit in London, we dive into the world of chaos engineering with guest Simon Hanmer, Principal Consultant at GlobalLogic and AWS Community Builder. Together with Tiffany and Sébastien, we unpack what chaos engineering is, why it matters for resilience in modern cloud architectures, and how AWS customers are adopting these practices today.

Simon explains how chaos engineering isn't about breaking things for fun, but about building confidence in how systems behave under stress—just like astronauts or firefighters train for the worst-case scenarios. We discuss AWS Fault Injection Service (FIS), best practices for injecting controlled failures, and how to safely test your assumptions before disaster strikes. Simon shares practical insights from his work with enterprise customers, the evolution of resilience testing from data centers to the cloud, and what’s next for chaos engineering, including integrating into CI/CD pipelines and shifting testing left.

If you're curious about how to make your cloud architecture truly resilient—or how Netflix and Amazon do it in production—this is the episode for you."
